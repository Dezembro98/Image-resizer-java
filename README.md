# Image-resizer-java
A resizing function for images in Java.
Receives a Buffered Image and returns another Buffered Image handled.
If the initial aspect ratio of the image differs from the final aspect ratio, the image will be filled with a color and the original image will be centered.

Currently it does not work to resize squares to rectangles

Example:
(Red is the input, black is the added margin)
